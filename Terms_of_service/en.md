Article 1 (Application & Definitions)
-------------------------------------

1. These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) set forth the conditions for the use of “AllergyReader” (the “App”) provided by [Developer/Company Name] (“the Company”).
2. In these Terms, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:  
   * **“User”**: any person who uses the App  
   * **“Premium Features”**: paid additional features as defined in Article 7
3. Users shall use the App upon agreeing to these Terms. By installing, launching, or otherwise starting to use the App, the User is deemed to have agreed to these Terms.

Article 2 (Use by Minors)
-------------------------

If a minor uses the App or makes any purchase, the minor must obtain the consent of a legal representative (such as a parent or guardian). The Company shall not be liable for any use or purchase made by a minor without such consent.

Article 3 (License)
-------------------

1. Subject to the User’s compliance with these Terms, the Company grants the User a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to use the App on the User’s device.
2. All intellectual property rights relating to the App are owned by the Company or its rightful owners. Any rights not expressly granted to the User are reserved by the Company.

Article 4 (Service Description & Environment)
---------------------------------------------

1. The App assists in detecting allergens and additives by scanning food labels with a camera and performing OCR (optical character recognition). Its main features include:  
   * Real-time OCR of food labels using the device camera  
   * Detection and display of registered allergens  
   * Saving scan history (Premium Features)  
   * Registering custom allergens (Premium Features)  
   * Additive detection (Premium Features)
2. Users shall prepare, at their own expense and responsibility, the necessary devices, OS, network environment, and apply the latest updates.
3. Use of the App may require permissions such as access to the device camera. Users can grant or revoke such permissions at any time via device settings.

Article 5 (Medical Notice & Disclaimer)
--------------------------------------

1. The App is **not** a medical device and is **not** intended to replace medical diagnosis or medical advice. Users must make final decisions regarding allergies at their own responsibility after consulting a qualified medical professional.
2. Due to technical constraints (limitations of OCR, lighting and shooting conditions, label condition and font size, etc.), **completeness and accuracy of detection cannot be guaranteed**. Results are for reference only; **always verify the actual ingredient list on the product**.
3. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, the Company shall **not** be liable for any damages arising from or related to the use or unavailability of the App (including health issues such as allergic reactions), **except in cases of the Company’s willful misconduct or gross negligence**.
4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company is liable to a User, the Company’s liability shall be limited to **direct and ordinary damages actually incurred** by the User due to causes attributable to the Company, up to the total amount actually paid by the User to the Company in the **preceding twelve (12) months** (or **JPY 0** if none). This limitation shall not apply to damages caused by the Company’s willful misconduct or gross negligence.
5. This Article does not unlawfully limit any User rights under the Consumer Contract Act or other mandatory laws, and applies only to the extent permitted by such laws.

2. Purchases of Premium Features are **one-time**; once purchased, the corresponding features remain available. However, this **does not guarantee the continued provision of the App itself** (see Article 11).
3. Purchases are made through Apple’s App Store. Payment terms and refund eligibility are governed by App Store terms and policies. Prices may be subject to applicable taxes.
4. In the event of device changes, previous purchases can be restored using the “Restore Purchases” function **only when using the same Apple ID**.

   * **Purposes of Use**: provision of app functions, quality improvement, and user support  
   * **Third-Party Provision**: personal data is not sold, lent, or provided to third parties except as required by law. For crash reporting and analytics, data may be provided to contractors (e.g., OS providers, analytics service providers).  
   * **Security Measures**: appropriate safeguards are implemented to prevent leakage, loss, or damage.  
   * **User Rights**: requests for disclosure, correction, suspension of use, deletion, etc. may be submitted to the contact in Article 14.
